# docker-exploit-dns
Docker based DNS &amp; Exploit host

Many thanks to [Al-Azif](https://github.com/Al-Azi), because I certainly didn't look at his config.. :)

## What it does:
- Setup DNS server for local hosting and blocking PS updates (PS4 and PS5)
- User guide redirection

## Building and running:
```bash
docker build -t dns-exploit-server .
docker run --network="host" -d --name dns-exploit-server -p 53:53/udp -p 80:80 -p 443:443 dns-exploit-server
```

## Using a custom payload host
By default the image containers a index.html which redirects the User Guide to [EchoStretches es7in1.site](es7in1.site). By adding a build argument you can get another payload host, it does have two requirements:

- GitHub HTTPS link
- The host needs to have /document/en/ps5 directory structure, or have proper rewriting to do so. 

Example using `IdleSauce's` payload host:
```bash
docker build --no-cache --build-arg PAYLOAD_HOST=https://github.com/idlesauce/PS5-Exploit-Host.git -t dns-exploit-server .
```
